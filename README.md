# GWD-Yolo-v1
I tried to compete in the Global Wheat Detection competition in Kaggle. Unfortunately, I missed the due date of submission. So I don't know the exact score of my model. But I could analyze what the model works well or not. 
 On my kaggle note, every code is on one notebook. This is just try to make my code module so I can reuse it next competition.
